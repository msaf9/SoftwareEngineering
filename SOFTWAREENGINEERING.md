## Introduction

## Topics

### Software Engineering

#### What is software engineering?

<p> Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users. </p>

### Models

1. Waterfall Model
2. V-Model
3. Iterative (and Incremental) Model
4. Prototyping Model
5. Spiral Model
6. Agile Methodology Development Models
   1. [Scrum Model](SCRUMMODEL.md)
   2. Kanban Model

### Software Management

<p>Project Management Software is software used by a wide range of industries for project planning, resource allocation and scheduling. It enables project managers as well as entire teams to control their budget, quality management and all documentation exchanged throughout a project. This software also serves as a platform for facilitating collaboration among project stakeholders.</p>
