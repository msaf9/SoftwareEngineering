<h1>Software Requirement</h1>

## Introudction

<p>The different stages of Software Requirement are:</p>

1. Elicitation
2. Analysis
3. Specification
4. Validation
5. Management

## Elicitation

<p>Elicitation is the gathering and discovery of requirements from stakeholders and other sources. A variety of techniques can be used such as joint application design (JAD) sessions, interviews, document analysis, focus groups, etc. Elicitation is the first step of requirements development.</p>

## Analysis

<p>Analysis is the logical breakdown that proceeds from elicitation. Analysis involves reaching a richer and more precise understanding of each requirement and representing sets of requirements in multiple, complementary ways.</p>

<p>Requirements Triage or prioritization of requirements is another activity which often follows analysis. This relates to Agile software development in planning phase, e.g. by Planning poker, however it might not be the same depending on the context and nature of project and requirements or product/ service that is getting build.</p>

## Specification

<p>Specification involves representing and storing the collected requirements knowledge in a persistent and well-organized fashion that facilitates effective communication and change management. Use cases, user stories, functional requirements, and visual analysis models are popular choices for requirements specification.</p>

## Validation

<p>Validation involves techniques to confirm that the correct set of requirements has been specified to build a solution that satisfies the project's business objectives.</p>

## Management

<p>Requirements change during projects and there are often many of them. Management of this change becomes paramount to ensuring that the correct software is built for the stakeholders.</p>
