## Introduction

### What is Programming?

    Programming is logic. Programming is thinking.

<p>Programming is making decisions, or telling the computer what decisions to make under different circumstances. Once you've clicked the red button, you can program a computer/browser to access data and make a network request.</p>

### What is Coding?

<p>Coding is a subset of programming. Coding encompasses the following topics and activities:</p>

- Programming languages
- A language's syntax and how it differs from other language's syntax
- Code arrangement
- Code optimization
- Debugging
- Writing and running tests
- Creating and using libraries and frameworks

### Programming Languages

<p>Computers operate in machine code or binary strings of 0s and 1s. Programming languages allow users to translate human-operated commands into a format that computers can understand and execute.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of programming languages, and each language allows users to write instructions in a different syntax. Low-level languages are more similar to machine code, while high-level languages use words like "run" and "object" that are more similar to traditional written language. Developers may write the source code in an IDE or text editor and then compile the code into a machine language.</p>

<p>Some of the programming languages:</p>
