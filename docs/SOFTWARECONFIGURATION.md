<h1> Software Configuration </h1>

## Introduction

<p>Software Configuration, sometimes called software change management or IT automation, the idea is to have a system in place to track and compare changes made across a system throughout the development process and also identify who made these revisions.</p>

<p>The purpose is to make project management easier, minimize errors, increase traceability, and improve overall software quality.</p>

## Benefits

<p>The benefits of a SCM process are:</p>

- Multi-User Updates:
  - Often many people work on software development, meaning there are constant updates and changes. SCM allows you to track all code and configurations deployed into production (aka a configuration audit) and also introduces traceability by determining which contributor made each one.
- Productivity:
  - SCM enhances the productivity of the software as it ensures minimal errors. For example, you can always make sure that your test and production environments match.
- Communication and Collaboration:
  - Communication between team members is easy with SCM, making it simple for stakeholders involved in the project to work together and enhance the quality of the product.
- Platform and OS Testing:
  - Ensure that the software runs effectively across multiple platforms and operating systems.
- Change Accommodation:
  - SCM makes it easier to accommodate changes in schedule, policy, and users.
- Cost Control:
  - By tracking team members and project workflow, SCM helps to control costs and increased efficiency.
