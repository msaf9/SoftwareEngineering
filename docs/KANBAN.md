<h1>Kanban Model</h1>

## Introduction

<p>Kanban is a very popular framework for development in the agile software development methodology. It provides a transparent way of visualizing the tasks and work capacity of a team. It mainly uses physical and digital boards to allow the team members to visualize the current state of the project they are working on.</p>

<p>Kanban originated in Toyota in the 1940s. Kanban’s meaning in Japanese is “billboards.” The Kanban board has columns and story cards. The columns are nothing, but workflow states and cards are nothing but a demonstration of the actual task a team member is performing.</p>
