<h1> Software Quality </h1>

## Introduction

<p>A software defect can be regarded as any failure to address end-user requirements. Common defects include missed or misunderstood requirements and errors in design, functional logic, data relationships, process timing, validity checking, and coding errors.</p>

<p>The software defect management approach is based on counting and managing defects. Defects are commonly categorized by severity, and the numbers in each category are used for planning. More mature software development organizations use tools, such as defect leakage matrices (for counting the numbers of defects that pass through development phases prior to detection) and control charts, to measure and improve development process capability.</p>

## Attributes approach

<p>This approach to software quality is best exemplified by fixed quality models, such as ISO/IEC 25010:2011. This standard describes a hierarchy of eight quality characteristics, each composed of sub-characteristics:</p>

1. Functional suitability
2. Reliability
3. Operability
4. Performance efficiency
5. Security
6. Compatibility
7. Maintainability
8. Transferability
